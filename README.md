### Biography

I am a cryptographer and co-founder at [TACEO GmbH](https://www.taceo.io/). Before that I obtained my [PhD](https://github.com/rw0x0/PhD) in Cryptography at Graz University of Technology. My main research interests include privacy enhancing technologies (FHE, MPC, ZKP), domain-specific symmetric primitives, and their application to real-world use cases.

Find more information about myself, my research, talks, and publications on my personal website [rwalch.at](https://rwalch.at/).

### Research Interests

- (Fully) Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)
- Multiparty Computation (MPC)
- Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)
- Post-Quantum Signatures
- Efficient Implementations
- Ciphers for MPC, FHE, and ZKP
