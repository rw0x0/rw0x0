### Biography

I am a co-founder of [TACEO GmbH](https://www.taceo.io/), researcher in cryptography, and Ph.D. student at [Know-Center GmbH](https://www.know-center.at/) in cooperation with the Institute of Applied Information Processing and Communications ([IAIK](https://www.iaik.tugraz.at/)) at Graz University of Technology. Before this, I completed my BSc and Dipl.-Ing. (equivalent to MSc) in computer engineering at TU Graz, with a focus on IT-Security. My main research interests include privacy enhancing technologies (FHE, MPC, ZKP), domain-specific symmetric primitives, and their application to real-world use cases.

### Research Interests

- (Fully) Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)
- Multiparty Computation (MPC)
- Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)
- Post-Quantum Signatures
- Efficient Implementations
- Ciphers for MPC, FHE, and ZKP
